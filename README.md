2. ```cd``` into the project directory
3. Run ```yarn install``` to add all the dependencies
4. Run ```yarn start``` to run the application

### Deployment to Chrome

3. Switch to your feature/working branch
    * When creating a new branch:
        * ```$ git checkout -b feature-addTime-#12-jon```
        * this will create the branch and immediately switch to that branch
